# Comparing C Compilers, Assembly, and Rust on ARM
This project is simply a benchmark of different compilers and compiler options to determine how compiling code compares to raw machine code.

The results for this project is [found here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zFoB-Re2FUpJ8RmOci6keissW4T4M-J4HF-Kcw57qKA/edit?usp=drive_link)

If you do want to run this, the code is optimized for the Raspberry Pi 5, but should work with anything that has a A76 CPU (like your Surface Pro X for all two of you who bought that).
